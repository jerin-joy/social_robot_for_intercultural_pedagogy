# Social Robot for Intercultural Pedagogy

This repository contains the code for a thesis project that investigates the use of a social robot, Nao, developed by Softbank Robotics, in facilitating intercultural pedagogy in daycare centers, nurseries, and preschools.

## Project Overview

The research involves kindergarten children from various cultural backgrounds engaging in a dynamic dialogue with the Nao robot. Utilizing a client-server model, the system orchestrates an interactive storytelling experiment where the robot poses culturally relevant questions, receives responses in diverse languages, and dynamically generates follow-up questions.

The proposed social robot aims to foster collaborative interactions and cultural exchange among diverse children, emphasizing storytelling as a means of language learning. Positioned for use in nurseries and kindergartens, the system navigates the challenges of language diversity through translation services, providing an inclusive educational tool for promoting global understanding.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack includes:

- Python for the client-server communication
- Google's text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs
- OpenAI API for translations
- The Protege ontology database for information retrieval

## Contribution to the Field

This research contributes to the emerging field of social robots in education, particularly in intercultural pedagogy. By leveraging advanced technologies, the proposed system showcases the potential for positive educational practices that celebrate diversity, laying the foundation for more inclusive and effective early childhood education.
